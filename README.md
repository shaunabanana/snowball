Snowball lets you quickly find and filter through papers using the snowballing method. Start with a core collection of papers, and find more by going through their citations and references.
<br/>
<br/>

## How to use

1. Start with a collection of papers. You can use a search engine like Web of Science or a reference manager like Zotero.
2. Export your "core" collection into a BibTeX/RIS/... file. Import it into Snowball.
3. Review the papers according to you inclusion criteria. Assign tags and write notes as necessary.
4. Once you've decided on a paper, tick/untick the switch for inclusion/exclusion.
5. After going through the list, click "Snowball from included papers" to find all citations and references of the included papers.
6. Go to step 3, rinse and repeat.
